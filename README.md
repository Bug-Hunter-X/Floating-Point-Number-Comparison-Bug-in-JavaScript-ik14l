# Floating-Point Number Comparison Bug in JavaScript This repository demonstrates a common subtle bug in JavaScript related to comparing floating-point numbers for equality.  The `foo` function aims to check if two numbers are equal, but it fails for certain floating-point numbers due to precision limitations. The solution demonstrates a more robust approach using a tolerance-based comparison.
